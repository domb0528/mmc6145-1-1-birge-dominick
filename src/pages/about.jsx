                Hello, I'm Dominick Birge, and I'm in my last semester at the University of Florida 🐊 🐊 . I used to live in Denver but now call Fort Lauderdale my home which is my hometown.

                I enjoy exploring nature and spending time with my family and the pets around the house which makes life lively and fun! Learning is a big part of my life, especially when it comes to making websites. I also like working on logos and marketing strategies for brands. By day, I work for the city government, and it's pretty cool helping out in the community. I serve the community by protecting the marine life and the sea turtles by making sure their nesting habitats on the beach stay safe and can prosper to allow the sea turtles to have their best possible life.

                If you want to get in touch, check out my contact page. I'm focused on becoming a better web developer, particularly in React. </article>
